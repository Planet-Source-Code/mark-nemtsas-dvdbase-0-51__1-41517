The cab file for your application has been built as 'M:\COMMON\Innovation Team\markn\DVDBase\Package\dvdbase.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (M:\COMMON\Innovation Team\markn\DVDBase\Package\Support\dvdbase.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
